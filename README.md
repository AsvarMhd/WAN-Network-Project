# WAN Network Configuration Project

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on configuring a WAN (Wide Area Network) using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network design simulates real-world scenarios involving multiple routers, switches, and end devices, providing practical insights into network topology, routing protocols, and connectivity.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Cisco Packet Tracer**
- **Networking Protocols**: RIP, OSPF
- **Hardware**:
  - 9 Routers
  - 8 Switches
  - 5 End Devices (PCs)

## 🎯 Objectives
- Establish seamless interconnection between multiple LANs through WAN.
- Implement static and dynamic routing.
- Ensure fault tolerance and redundancy.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- **Multiple Routing Protocols**: Configuration of RIP, OSPF.
- **Subnetting**: Effective subnetting to optimize IP allocation.
- **Troubleshooting**: Simulation of network failures and applying troubleshooting techniques.
